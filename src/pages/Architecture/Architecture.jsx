                        <p className="headline-subtext additional-information-wrapper">Email triaging involves efficiently sorting and prioritizing incoming emails based on relevance, urgency, and importance. It includes quickly scanning emails, categorizing them, and deciding whether to respond immediately, delegate, schedule for later, or archive. This process helps manage inboxes more effectively, ensuring important messages are addressed promptly and reducing time spent on less critical ones. By organizing and prioritizing, email triaging boosts productivity, reduces overload, and ensures key communications are not missed.</p>
